Hey there, I'm so glad you're here!
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!
I'm passionate about growing in my career, picking up new tech sills, and making work life a little less overwhelming
( and a lot more fun). Here, you'll find:
   
   • Projects I'm building or contributing to
   • Things I've learned while juggling work, deadlines and debugging
   • Bits of inspiration for everyone trying to survive —one thrive— in the corporate world
Whether you're here to find useful code, get inspired, or just see how someone else is figuring it all out — you're in the right place!
